# Google Search API Rate Limiting Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of rate limiting for Google Search API requests in the Pulse system. The implementation ensures that Google Search API requests do not exceed 90 requests per day.

## Changes Made

### 1. Environment Configuration
- **.env file**: Added `GOOGLE_SEARCH_RATE_LIMIT=90` to the rate limiting section
- **Docker Compose**: Added `- GOOGLE_SEARCH_RATE_LIMIT=${GOOGLE_SEARCH_RATE_LIMIT:-90}` to the worker environment variables
- **Kubernetes Config**: Added `GOOGLE_SEARCH_RATE_LIMIT: "90"` to the config.yaml file
- **Kubernetes Worker**: Added environment variable reference to the worker.yaml deployment

### 2. Application Configuration
- **worker/celery_app.py**: Added `google_search_rate_limit: int = 90` to the WorkerSettings class
- **backend/app/config.py**: Added `google_search_rate_limit: int = 90` to the Settings class

### 3. Rate Limiting Implementation
- **worker/adapters/news_fetcher.py**: 
  - Added `RateLimiter` class for generic rate limiting functionality
  - Integrated rate limiting into `GoogleSearchFetcher` class:
    - Added `self.rate_limiter = RateLimiter(max_requests=90, time_window=86400)` in the constructor
    - Added rate limit check at the beginning of `fetch_articles` method
    - Added request recording after successful API calls

## Rate Limiter Details
The `RateLimiter` class implements a sliding window rate limiter that:
- Tracks timestamps of all requests within a specified time window
- Removes expired requests from the tracking list
- Prevents new requests when the limit is exceeded
- Provides wait time information when the limit is exceeded

### Configuration
- **Max Requests**: 90 per time window
- **Time Window**: 86400 seconds (24 hours)
- **Behavior**: When limit is exceeded, raises an exception with wait time information

## Testing
Several test scripts were created to verify the implementation:
- `test_google_rate_limit.py`: Tests basic rate limiting functionality
- `test_google_rate_limit_simulation.py`: Tests rate limiting behavior by simulating limit hits
- `test_comprehensive_rate_limiting.py`: Comprehensive tests for all rate limiting components

## Verification
The implementation has been verified to:
1. Load the correct rate limit from environment variables (90 requests/day)
2. Initialize the RateLimiter with correct parameters (90 requests per 86400 seconds)
3. Properly enforce rate limits when making API requests
4. Provide appropriate error messages when limits are exceeded

## Integration Points
The rate limiting is integrated into the GoogleSearchFetcher class, which is used by:
- The main NewsFetcher class as the primary news source
- The hybrid fetching approach that combines multiple news sources

This ensures that all Google Search API requests made through the Pulse system are rate-limited to prevent exceeding the daily quota.
