## Key Features Implemented

### Content Ranking Algorithm
The content ranking system uses a weighted composite score:
- **Relevance (40%)**: Based on content quality and keyword matching
- **Freshness (30%)**: Exponentially decaying score based on publication time
- **Source Authority (20%)**: Predefined scores for trusted sources
- **Engagement Potential (10%)**: Title characteristics that drive engagement

### Multi-stage Summarization
1. **Initial Summarization**: Basic LLM-based content summarization
2. **Fact Extraction**: Identification of factual statements
3. **Fact Verification**: Confidence scoring of extracted facts
4. **Refined Summarization**: Incorporation of verified facts
5. **Tone Adjustment**: Style adaptation based on content niche

### A/B Testing Framework
- **Variant Generation**: Multiple content variants using different strategies
- **Experiment Management**: Creation and tracking of experiments
- **Weighted Selection**: Performance-based variant selection
- **Metrics Collection**: CTR and conversion rate tracking

### Enhanced Security
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Data Encryption**: Field-level encryption for sensitive data
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and DoS attacks
- **Input Sanitization**: Protection against injection attacks

## Impact on System Quality

### Reliability
