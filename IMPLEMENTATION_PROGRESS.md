## Next Steps üöÄ

Based on the priority and feasibility, the next enhancements to implement should be:

1. **Advanced Testing Strategy**
   - Implement contract testing with Pact
   - Add load testing with Locust
   - Set up chaos engineering experiments

2. **Enhanced Database Optimization**
   - Add advanced indexing strategies
   - Implement table partitioning
   - Create materialized views for analytics

3. **Multi-Stage Summarization**
   - Add fact extraction and verification
   - Implement tone and style adjustment

4. **A/B Testing Framework**
   - Create framework for content optimization experiments

5. **Business Intelligence**
   - Implement real-time analytics dashboard
   - Add predictive analytics capabilities

These enhancements will bring Pulse closer to a production-grade, enterprise-ready system as outlined in the perfection guide.
